# Pac-Gif

Pac-Gif is a test project aimed at creating a GIF capture tool similar to Gyazo using Tauri, Rust, and Svelte. The project is still in its early stages and is not yet finished. Currently, it has some bugs related to color rendering, but it's a good starting point for experimentation and learning.

## Features

- **GIF Capture**: Capture parts of your screen and save them as GIFs.
- **Built with Tauri**: Utilizes Tauri for building a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application.
- **Rust Backend**: Rust is used for handling performance-intensive tasks like GIF creation.
- **Svelte Frontend**: A simple Svelte interface for interacting with the application.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Known Issues

- **Color Rendering Bug**: There is an ongoing issue with color rendering during GIF capture. It needs further refinement.
